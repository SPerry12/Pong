# Pong

I created this Pong game using the tutorial, Java pong game, from the Bro Code YouTube channel.

I decided to follow this tutorial in order to learn more about game loops and continue to hone my Java skills. One of the aspects of the video I found interesting was
how the demonstrator decided to work on each class at one time instead of one class at a time. The way the video went was each class was created, then all the variables
for each class were initialized, then each constructor for each class was created and finally the methods of each class were created. I thought this approach was a good
way to start small in a project and allow the programmer to think about easy tasks first. I think I may try to take this approach in the future.

For this mini-project I also leared how to use Git inside the Eclipse IDE. For help with this I used a tutorial, How To Add Eclipse Project To GitHub..., from 
Automation Step by Step.
